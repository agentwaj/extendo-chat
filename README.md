# Extendo Chat
Chrome extension to remove trim from Messenger message preview.

Have you ever wanted the full scoop on what someone just messaged you but you didn't want to open the message up and mark it as read? Well now the scoop is all yours! After you install this extension, the sidebar in Messenger will show the most recent messages you've received in full.

This extension does not require any special permissions or access to your Facebook account.
